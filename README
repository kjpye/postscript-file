PostScript::File version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}

This module produces the outline for an Adobe PostScript file. It provides
convenient routines for writing postscript directly, including reporting
postscript errors and debugging support.  Although it may be used independently,
the functions provided are also suitable for use in other modules.  See one of
these modules for a top-level object.

    PostScript::Graph::XY
    PostScript::Graph::Bar
    Finance::Shares::Chart

It is considered beta code as the interface has remained stable over many months
of use.  However, not all the features have been tested properly so experiment
with caution.
