This module provides the outline for an Adobe PostScript file and provides
convenient routines for writing postscript directly.  These include reporting
postscript errors and debugging support.  Here is the ubiquetous 'hello world'
program, written in PostScript using this module.

    use PostScript::Graph::File;
    my $ps = new PostScript::Graph::File( 
	    errors => 1,
	    debug => 2 
	);
    
    my ($x, $y) = (72, 300);
    my $message = "hello world";
    
    $ps->add_to_page( <<END_PAGE );
	/Helvetica findfont 
	12 scalefont 
	setfont
	$x $y moveto
	($message) show
    END_PAGE
    
    $ps->output( "~/hello" );
